The Emacs Lisp Python Environment.

Elpy is a mode for Emacs to support writing Python code. This package
provides the backend within Python to support auto-completion,
documentation extraction, and navigation.

Emacs will start the protocol by running the module itself, like so:

  python -m elpy

This will emit a greeting string on a single line, and then wait for
the protocol to start. Details of the protocol can be found in
elpy.rpc.

This package is unlikely to be useful on its own.
